 *      - the owner can decide if they can see other metadata (metadata-paywall)
 *      - the owner can decide if they can save and use it for personal/business use (usage-rights-paywall)
 *      - the owner can sell it and effectively change the owner in exchange for fiat/crypto ("nft" trade)
 * 
 * 3) PRIVATE - not visible, nsfw, not displayed on activity feed 
 *      - the owner can decide who see the prompt, (prompt-paywall)

 * 1) Store on wp only, let's not overcomplicate things right from the start, (maybe have a copy on ipfs? and store the CID as meta? )
 * 
 * 2) Blockchain, smart contract, let them store the data where they want and access in wallet?  (need to learn a lot here)
