how to save file on ipfs via javascript 
To save a file to IPFS using JavaScript, you can use the ipfs-api library. Here's an example of how you can do this in a Node.js environment:

Copy code
const IPFS = require('ipfs-api');
const ipfs = new IPFS({ host: 'ipfs.infura.io', port: 5001, protocol: 'https' });

const fileBuffer = Buffer.from('Hello, World!');

ipfs.add(fileBuffer, (error, result) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return;
  }

  console.log(result[0].hash);
});
This code will save the file 'Hello, World!' to IPFS and log the resulting IPFS hash to the console.

Note that you can also use the ipfs.addFromFs method to save a file from the filesystem, or the ipfs.addFromStream method to save a file from a stream.

You can also use the ipfs.addJson method to save JSON data to IPFS. For example:

Copy code
const data = { message: 'Hello, World!' };

ipfs.addJson(data, (error, result) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return;
  }

  console.log(result[0].hash);
});
This will save the JSON object { message: 'Hello, World!' } to IPFS and log the resulting IPFS hash to the console.

how much money it costs per 100kb of json data stored on ipfs? 
It is generally free to store data on IPFS. IPFS is a decentralized network, so there is no central authority that charges for storage. Instead, storage on IPFS is provided by nodes on the network, which contribute their resources in exchange for a small fee paid in the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain that the IPFS network is built on (typically, this is Ether for the Ethereum blockchain).

As a result, the cost of storing data on IPFS will depend on the fees charged by the nodes that you are using to store your data. These fees can vary depending on the current demand for storage on the network and the resources that the node operator is willing to commit.

It is also worth noting that while IPFS itself is free to use, there are some services (such as Pinata and Textile) that provide additional features and support for IPFS, and these services may charge fees for their use.

In general, it is difficult to give a precise estimate of the cost of storing data on IPFS, as it will depend on a variety of factors. However, in most cases, the cost of storing data on IPFS is likely to be significantly lower than the cost of storing the same data on a traditional centralized storage platform.

can I just use it without the need of any monetary obligations whatsover on a large scale? 
Yes, you can use IPFS without any monetary obligations on a large scale. As I mentioned earlier, IPFS is a decentralized network, so there is no central authority that charges for storage. Instead, storage on IPFS is provided by nodes on the network, which contribute their resources in exchange for a small fee paid in the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain that the IPFS network is built on (typically, this is Ether for the Ethereum blockchain).

However, it is worth noting that while IPFS itself is free to use, there are some services (such as Pinata and Textile) that provide additional features and support for IPFS, and these services may charge fees for their use.

In general, the cost of storing data on IPFS will depend on the fees charged by the nodes that you are using to store your data. These fees can vary depending on the current demand for storage on the network and the resources that the node operator is willing to commit. However, in most cases, the cost of storing data on IPFS is likely to be significantly lower than the cost of storing the same data on a traditional centralized storage platform.

It is also worth noting that while IPFS is a highly scalable and resilient network, it may not be suitable for all use cases, and it is important to carefully consider the trade-offs of using a decentralized storage solution like IPFS. For example, IPFS may not offer the same level of reliability or performance as a centralized storage solution, and it may require more effort to integrate into your workflow.
